# Clever API for Twitter Service (CATS)


## Description

Build a simple social networking application, similar to Twitter, and expose it through a web API. The application should support the scenarios below.

### Scenarios

#### Posting
A user should be able to post a 140 character message.

#### Wall
A user should be able to see a list of the messages they've posted, in reverse chronological order.

#### Following
A user should be able to follow another user. Following doesn't have to be reciprocal: Alice can follow Bob without Bob having to follow Alice.

#### Timeline
A user should be able to see a list of the messages posted by all the people they follow, in reverse chronological order.
